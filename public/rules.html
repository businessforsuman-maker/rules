            <h2>Keeping the Vibe Right: Our Simple Community Guidelines</h2>
            <p class="subtitle">These are the common-sense rules that apply to every single comment, reply, and interaction you have here on 9Anime. Let's make this a great place for everyone!</p>
            <div class="note-box">
                <p><strong>Heads Up:</strong> Every single person needs to follow these. If you break them, we might have to delete your comment, send a warning, mute you for a bit, or, for the really serious stuff, give you the permanent boot. We're just trying to keep the peace!</p>

            <div class="rule-card">
                <h3>1. Be a Decent Human: Respect & Civility</h3>
                <p>We're all here because we love anime, so let's keep the conversation fun and friendly. Absolutely no personal attacks, insults, bullying, or any kind of hate speech. This is a zero-tolerance zone for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Targeting someone based on who they are (race, gender, religion, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Repeatedly harassing or stalking another user—that's just creepy.</li>
                    <li>Threats of any kind (including digging up and sharing personal info, or threats of real-life harm).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It's totally fine to disagree with an idea or a show's plot, but **never** attack the person behind the keyboard.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="rule-card">
                <h3>2. Seriously, Tag Your Spoilers!</h3>
                <p>Nobody likes having a major plot twist ruined! If you're talking about anything that hasn't happened in the current episode—whether it's from the manga, light novel, or even a future episode—you **must** hide it.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use the spoiler button or type it out like this: <code>[spoiler]text here[/spoiler]</code></li>
                    <li>Even tiny hints count as spoilers, so when in doubt, tag it!</li>
                    <li>Don't put spoilers in your username or profile picture—that's just mean.</li>
                    <li>First time you forget? We'll delete it and send a warning. Keep doing it? You'll get muted or banned.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="rule-card">
                <h3>3. Keep It About the Anime</h3>
                <p>Let's keep the comments focused on the show we're all watching. We're not the place for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Political or religious debates—take those elsewhere, please.</li>
                    <li>Starting drama or fights about other streaming sites.</li>
                    <li>Begging for links, downloads, or asking when the next episode drops (we'll post it when it's ready!).</li>
                    <li>Spamming "Episode X when?"—it just clogs up the feed.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="rule-card">
                <h3>4. No Shady or Harmful Stuff (Instant Ban)</h3>
                <p>This is the serious stuff. If you post any of the following, you're getting an **immediate, permanent ban** with no warning. We have to protect the community:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Links to torrents, illegal downloads, or other streaming sites.</li>
                    <li>Pornography, gore, shock images, or anything NSFW.</li>
                    <li>Malware, phishing links, or scams—don't try it.</li>
                    <li>Sharing anyone's personal information (doxxing).</li>
                    <li>Threats or encouraging violence/self-harm.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="rule-card">
                <h3>5. No Spamming or Shameless Self-Promotion</h3>
                <p>Our filters are pretty good at catching this, and it will be automatically removed:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Repetitive messages, copypastas, or flooding the comments.</li>
                    <li>Posting Discord invites, YouTube/TikTok channels, or referral links.</li>
                    <li>Begging for likes, subscribers, or followers—earn them!</li>
                    <li>Advertising any product or service.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="rule-card">
                <h3>6. Language & How You Act</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>We need to be able to moderate, so please keep the majority of your comment in **English**.</li>
                    <li>Short phrases in other languages are totally fine!</li>
                    <li>Excessive swearing, screaming in ALL CAPS, or generally toxic behavior will be removed.</li>
                    <li>Don't try to pretend you're a moderator or staff member—that's an instant permanent ban.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="rule-card">
                <h3>7. How We Enforce Things (The Mod Process)</h3>
                <p>We try to be fair and consistent. For minor slip-ups (like forgetting a spoiler tag or being a little too spicy):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>**First Time:** A friendly warning.</li>
                    <li>**Second Time:** A temporary mute (24–72 hours).</li>
                    <li>**Third Time:** A longer temporary ban (7–30 days).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For the really bad stuff (hate speech, illegal links, threats, doxxing) → **Immediate permanent ban, no exceptions, no appeal.** We take the safety of our community seriously.</p>
