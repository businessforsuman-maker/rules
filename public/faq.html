                <summary>Wait, how do I hide those pesky spoilers?</summary>
                <p>Oh, the spoiler struggle is real! We all hate accidentally ruining a big moment. To be a good community member, just wrap your spoiler text like this: <code>[spoiler]your text here[/spoiler]</code>. Or, look for the little spoiler button right in the comment box—it's your best friend! If you forget, a moderator will have to step in and delete it, and nobody wants that.</p>
            </details>
            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>My comment vanished! Why did the mods delete it?</summary>
                <p>Ugh, that's frustrating, I know. Usually, it's for one of the common reasons: you forgot to tag a spoiler (oops!), things got a little too heated or toxic (let's keep the peace!), the discussion went completely off-topic, or it looked like spam. Don't worry, we always try to send you a notification with the exact reason so you know what happened and can avoid it next time. We're not trying to be mean, just keeping the place tidy!</p>

            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>I got the dreaded ban hammer. Can I please appeal it?</summary>
                <p>If it's a permanent ban, yes, absolutely! We believe in second chances and fairness. The notification you received should include a link specifically for appeals. Just follow that and tell us your side of the story. Now, if it was just a temporary mute, you'll have to ride that one out—those can't be appealed, sorry!</p>

            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>Can I chat in a language other than English?</summary>
                <p>We love that our community is global! You're welcome to chat in other languages, but please remember that our moderation team primarily operates in English. If there's a huge flood of non-English comments, we might have to remove them just so our mods can keep up and ensure everyone is following the rules. A little bit is fine, but let's try to keep the main discussion in English for everyone's sake!</p>

            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>Is it okay to link to other streaming sites?</summary>
                <p>Hard no on this one, folks. We have to be super strict about external links to other streaming or download sites. We consider that spam, and our automated filters are set to instantly remove them. It's nothing personal, it's just a policy we have to enforce to keep the community safe and focused.</p>
            </details>
            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>How exactly do you guys enforce all these rules?</summary>
                <p>It's a team effort! We've got a great system that combines smart, 24/7 automated filters to catch the obvious stuff (like spam and bad links) with our dedicated human moderators who handle the nuanced situations. We really, really try to be fair and consistent with every decision. We're just regular people trying to make this the best community possible!</p>
